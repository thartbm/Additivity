# AimingEffects

The repository is an RStudio project: create a new Project in RStudio, based on version control > git, and then copy-paste the .git link: `https://github.com/thartbm/AimingEffects.git`.

This project uses `renv` in an attempt to make sure the same (versions of) R packages are used to pre-process the data as when we originally wrote the scripts. This may take some time, especially when first opening the RStudio project.

In this project we analyze data from three groups doing a 30 degree visuomotor rotation adaptation.
