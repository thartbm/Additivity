# Additivity

In this project we analyze data from three groups doing a 30 degree visuomotor rotation adaptation, and data collected from various previous projects representing a variety of labs, equipment, study protocols, measures, etc. In both sets of data we ask if implicit and explicit adaptation linearly add to total adaptation, but do not find it.

The repository is an RStudio project: create a new Project in RStudio, based on version control > git, and then copy-paste the .git link: `https://github.com/thartbm/Additivity.git`.

Open the notebook to reproduce most analyses and all figures presented in the paper. Some analyses are present in scripts only.

This project uses `renv` in an attempt to make sure the same (versions of) R packages are used to pre-process the data as when we originally wrote the scripts. This may take some time, especially when first opening the RStudio project.
